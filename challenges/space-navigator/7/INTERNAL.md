## Learning

The challenge will be the same as the challenge before but with a
WAF (web application firewall) implemented in javascript and used with
the isolation pattern.
Participants learn how to bypass trivial WAFs and that the isolation
pattern can be used from the frontend to filter/sanitize/alert messages
passed to the backend.
