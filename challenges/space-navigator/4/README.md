## Description

We already configured the coordinates to Earth in the last procedure but it seems
like we have left out some important spacetime variable.
We can not change the file anymore, so we need to figure out a way to add the
spacetime `[12,45,34,55]` variable to the coordinate.

It should give us a confirmation code of the correct space drift calculation
once the coordinates are successfully set and the system accepted the destination.

There are some custom commands we know about. For some we know more but some are still
obscure to us.

> TODO: Insert some documentation for custom commmands where some have extended documentation
and for some we only have partial knowlegde about the signature and payload.
