## Description

We already know the coordinates but can not get them into our system.
The input interface seems broken and we maybe need to directly speak to
backend system via the developer console of the application.

Once we have the coordinates in the system the ship can start to set
course on Earth. Finally!
It should give us a confirmation code once the coordinates are successfully set.
